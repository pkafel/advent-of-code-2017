# Advent of code 2017

My solutions for the challanges from [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/). 

## Disclaimer

The solutions presented in this repository are potentially not even close to optimal. The reason for that is:
* They are written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) which is not my primary programming language of choice.
* Im busy father and full time developer with a very limited time. Advent of code is my way of having fun.

Because of that please do not take my solutions too seriously.
